</div>

<p>So the goat and the ram made themselves a bag, and went off. And they
went on and on, when suddenly they saw a wolf's head lying in the middle
of the field.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

</div>

<p>And they picked up the head, put it in their bag, and went on again. And
they went on and on, when suddenly they saw a fire burning, and they
said: &ldquo;Let's go and spend the night there, lest the wolves should eat
us.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus-0024-1.jpg" width="600" height="330" style="margin-top: 2em;" alt="" title="But when they got there" />
</div>

<p>But when they got there, lo and behold! it was the wolves
themselves who were cooking their porridge, and so they said: &ldquo;Good
evening, young fellows, and good appetite to you!&rdquo; And the wolves
answered: &ldquo;Good evening, Mr. Goat and Mr. Ram! We're just boiling our
porridge, come and have some, and then we'll eat you both up.&rdquo; At this
the goat took fright, while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> as for the ram, his legs had been shaking
with fear for some time. Then the goat began to think, and he thought
and thought and at last he said: &ldquo;Come now, Mr. Ram, let's have a look
at that wolf's head you've got in your sack!&rdquo; And the ram took out the
wolf's head, when the goat said: &ldquo;No, not that one. Let's have the other
bigger one!&rdquo; And again the ram gave him the same head, but he said: &ldquo;No,
not that one either! let's have the largest of all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the wolves looked, and thought the ram had a whole sackful of
wolves' heads, and each one of them said to himself: &ldquo;Well, these are
nice guests to have! I'd better hop off!&rdquo; And first one said aloud to
the others: &ldquo;I like your company all right, brothers, but somehow, the
porridge doesn't seem to be boiling very well. I'll just run and fetch
some sticks to throw on the fire.&rdquo; And as he went off, he thought to
himself: &ldquo;You and your company be bothered!&rdquo;&mdash;and never came back.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

</div>

<p>Then the second wolf kept thinking how he could get away, and he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> said:
&ldquo;It seems very funny, our brother went to fetch the wood, but he hasn't
brought the wood, and hasn't come back himself. I'll just go and help
him!&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus-0027-1.jpg" width="600" height="351" style="margin-top: 2em;" alt="" title="So off he went too" />
</div>

<p>So off he went too, and never came back. And the third wolf was
left sitting there, and at last he said: &ldquo;I must really go and hurry
them up. What are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> they dawdling all this time for!&rdquo; And as soon as he
was gone, he set off running and never so much as looked back.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p style="margin-top: 13em;">And at that the ram and the goat were delighted. They ate up all the
porridge and then ran away themselves.</p>



<p style="clear: both;">Meanwhile the wolves had all three met, and they said: &ldquo;Look here, why
were we three frightened of the goat and the ram? They're no stronger
than we, after all! Let's go and do them in!&rdquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 9em;">But when they came back to the fire, there was not so much as a trace of
them left. Then the wolves set off<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> in pursuit, and at last they saw
them, where they had climbed up a tree, the goat on an upper and the ram
on a lower branch. So the eldest wolf lay<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> down under the tree, and
began to show his teeth, looking up at them, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> waiting for them to
climb down. And the ram, who was trembling all over from fright,
suddenly fell down right on top of the wolf, and at the same minute the
goat shouted out from up above: &ldquo;There, that's the one! get me the
largest of all!&rdquo; And the wolf was terrified, because he thought the ram
had jumped down after him, and you should just have seen him run! And
the other two followed after.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

look to see what he could find for dinner. After a bit he saw a ram
feeding<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> in a meadow, so he went up to him and said: &ldquo;Mr. Ram, Mr. Ram,

answered the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> ram, &ldquo;you're not, you're a dog!&rdquo; &ldquo;No, I'm not a dog,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;I'm a wolf.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; answered the ram, &ldquo;if you're a wolf,
stand at the bottom of the hill and open your jaws wide. Then I'll run
down the hill and jump straight into your mouth.&rdquo; &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>So he stood at the bottom of the hill and opened his mouth wide, while
the ram climbed to the top of the hill. Then he ran down the hill very
fast, and hit the wolf with his horns as hard as he could.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 450px;">

</div>

<p style="margin-top: 12em;">The wolf rolled over, knocked senseless with the blow, while the ram ran
off home. And there lay the wolf, till at last he came to himself again,
with all his bones aching.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what a fool I must have been!&rdquo; thought he. &ldquo;Who ever saw a ram
jump into one's mouth of his own free will?&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he went on further, just as hungry as ever, and after a bit he saw
a horse walking in a meadow nibbling the grass.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;">
<img src="images/illus-0039-1.jpg" width="650" height="389" style="margin-top: 2em;" alt="" title="But the horse answered" />
</div>

<p>So he went up to him and said: &ldquo;Mr. Horse, Mr. Horse, I'm going to eat
you!&rdquo; But the horse answered: &ldquo;Who are you, I should like to know,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> that
you mean to eat me?&rdquo; &ldquo;I'm a wolf!&rdquo; &ldquo;You think again,&rdquo; answered the
horse, &ldquo;You're only a dog!&rdquo; &ldquo;No, I'm not a dog,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I'm a wolf.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Oh, if you are sure you're a wolf, it's all right. Only I'm not very
fat yet, so you'd better begin on my tail, and meanwhile I'll be
munching some more grass and get a little fuller.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 650px;">

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>


<p>So the wolf went up to him from behind, and was just going to get to
work on his tail, when the horse let out at him as hard as he could! And
the wolf rolled over, while the horse ran off.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>And there sat the wolf, and he thought: &ldquo;Well, wasn't I a fool! wasn't I
a noodle! Who ever heard of anyone starting to eat a horse by the tail?&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/illus-0042-1.jpg" width="600" height="333" style="margin-top: 2em;" alt="" title="And there sat the wolf" />
</div>

<p>And so he wandered on further, when after a bit he saw a pig coming
towards him, so when he got to him he said: &ldquo;Mr. Pig, Mr. Pig, I'm going
to eat you!&rdquo; But the pig answered: &ldquo;Who are you, I should like to know,
that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> you mean to eat me?&rdquo; &ldquo;I'm a wolf.&rdquo; &ldquo;You're a queer sort of wolf,&rdquo;
answered the pig, &ldquo;you're only a dog!&rdquo; &ldquo;No, I'm not a dog,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;I'm a wolf!&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, that's all right then,&rdquo; answered the pig, &ldquo;you just
sit down on my back. I'll give you a ride, and then you can eat me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once upon a time a certain peasant lost his wife, then he lost his other
relations, and then he was left alone with no one to help him in his
home or his fields. So he went to Bruin and said: &ldquo;Look here, Bruin,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
let's keep house and plant our garden and sow our corn together.&rdquo; And
Bruin asked: &ldquo;But how shall we divide it afterwards?&rdquo; &ldquo;How shall we
divide it?&rdquo; said the peasant, &ldquo;Well, you take all the tops and let me
have all the roots.&rdquo; &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; answered Bruin. So they sowed some
turnips, and they grew beautifully. And Bruin worked hard, and gathered
in all the turnips, and then they began to divide them. And the peasant
said: &ldquo;The tops are yours, aren't they, Bruin?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered. So
the peasant cut off all the turnip tops and gave them to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> Bruin, and
then sat down to count the roots. And Bruin saw that the peasant had
done him down.</p>

&ldquo;Right-ho! only this time mind! you can have the tops, but I'm going to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
have the roots!&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the peasant. And they sowed some
wheat, and when the ears grew up and ripened, you never saw such a
sight. Then they began to divide it, and the peasant took all the tops
with the grain, and gave Bruin the straw and the roots. So he didn't get
anything that time either.</p>

<p>One summer a certain peasant's crops failed him, and so he had no food
to give to his animals, which were a cock and a dog. And the dog said to
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span> cock: &ldquo;Well, brother Peeter, I think we should get more to eat if
we went and lived in the forest than here at our master's, don't you?&rdquo;

spend the night on a tree. I'll fly up on to a branch, and you take
shelter in the hollow. We'll<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> get through the night somehow.&rdquo;</p>

began to get light, the cock woke up and, as was his custom, crew as

and let King Frost give her a share too!&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>So the old man took her daughter, left her in the forest, and then drove
off home. And there the girl sat, with her teeth chattering with the
cold,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> when lo and behold! there was King Frost coming along, and he
said: &ldquo;Hullo, little girl, are you warm?&rdquo;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<p>And she answered: &ldquo;What's that
got to do with you? Go away to where you came from!&rdquo; And King Frost grew
angry and blew a cold breath on to the girl, and then asked her: &ldquo;Are
you warm, little girl?&rdquo; And she answered: &ldquo;Fancy asking! You can see I'm
frozen! Be quick and give me the presents, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> then get away to your
home.&rdquo; Then King Frost began to make the girl still colder. And he kept
making it colder and colder till he had frozen her through and through.</p>

the trunk and the fine clothes as well.&rdquo; So the old man started off, and
his wife began to watch at the window.</p>

<p>She waited and waited, and at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> last she saw her husband driving towards
home, and said to herself: &ldquo;That's all right, there comes the old man

down the sack and ran off home. And the eldest sister asked him: &ldquo;Did

<p>The next day the old woman again sat down under the tree to spin her
flax while the ox fed, and she began spinning and saying to herself:
&ldquo;Feed, feed, ox, on the fresh green grass! Feed, feed, ox, on the fresh
green grass!&rdquo; And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> she went on spinning and spinning and fell asleep.
Suddenly from out of the thick wood, from out of the dark forest, a grey
hare came running and ran right up against the ox. &ldquo;What sort of beast
are you?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I'm the three-year-old ox, all made of straw and
smeared over with pitch.&rdquo; Then the hare said: &ldquo;Well then, give me some
pitch to rub on my side.&rdquo; &ldquo;Take some!&rdquo; answered the ox. And the hare
caught hold of him with his teeth, when lo and behold! his teeth stuck
fast. He tore and tore, but couldn't tear them free. And the old woman
woke up, and ran to fetch her husband, and said: &ldquo;Come as quick as you
can, there's a hare stuck to the ox!&rdquo; And the old man came, took the
hare and flung<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span> him into the cellar. Then the old man began to grind his
knife, and the bear heard him and asked: &ldquo;What are you grinding your
knife for?&rdquo; And he answered: &ldquo;I'm grinding my knife to take the skin off
your back and make myself a fur coat out of it.&rdquo; But the bear said: &ldquo;Oh!
don't take the skin off my back! Better let me go free, and I'll repay
you handsomely.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, mind you do!&rdquo; answered the old man, and so he
let the bear go free, and he ran off into the forest.</p>

<p>The next day the old man again began to grind his knife<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span> outside the
cellar, and the wolf asked him: &ldquo;What are you grinding your knife for?&rdquo;
And he answered: &ldquo;I'm grinding my knife to take the skin off your back
and make myself a fur coat out of it.&rdquo; But the wolf said: &ldquo;Oh!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span> don't
take the skin off my back! Better let me go free, and I'll repay you
handsomely.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, mind you do!&rdquo; answered the old man, and so he let
the wolf too go free. And again he began to grind his knife outside the
cellar, and the fox asked him: &ldquo;What are you grinding your knife for?&rdquo;
And he answered: &ldquo;I'm grinding my knife to take the skin off your back,
and make myself out of it a collar for my fur coat.&rdquo; But the fox said:
&ldquo;Oh! don't take the skin off my back! Better let me go free, and I'll
repay you handsomely.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, mind you do!&rdquo; answered he.</p>

<p>Then the hare was left all alone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>And again the old man began to grind his knife, and the hare asked him:
&ldquo;What are you grinding your knife for?&rdquo; And he answered: &ldquo;I'm grinding
my knife to take the skin off your back, and make myself some fur gloves
out of it.&rdquo; But the hare said: &ldquo;Oh! don't take the skin off my back!
Better let me go free, and I'll repay you handsomely.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, mind you
do!&rdquo; he answered, and let the hare too go free.</p>

<p>Early the next morning the old man heard someone knocking at the gate,
so he asked: &ldquo;Who's there?&rdquo; And the answer came: &ldquo;It's I, the bear, come
to pay you my debt.&rdquo; And the old man opened the gate, and there was the
bear with a hive of honey he had brought. So the old man took the honey,
when again he heard knock-knock<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span> at the gate! &ldquo;Who's there?&rdquo; he asked,
and the answer came: &ldquo;It's I, the wolf, come to pay you my debt.&rdquo; And
there was the wolf with a whole flock of sheep he had driven up. So the
old man let the sheep into the yard, when again he heard knock-knock at
the gate. &ldquo;Who's there?&rdquo; he asked, and the answer came: &ldquo;It's I, the
fox, come to pay you my debt.&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>And there was the fox with a whole
farm-yardful of cocks and hens, and ducks and geese. Suddenly there came
another knock-knock at the gate. &ldquo;Who's there?&rdquo; asked the old man, and
the answer came: &ldquo;It's I, the hare, come to pay you my debt.&rdquo; And he had
brought with him a whole<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span> heap of cabbages. And the old man and his wife
began to live happily together, and always spoke well and kindly of
those beasts.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;">A fox was walking through the forest when he fell into a deep hole. And
there he sat and sat, till all at once he began to feel hungry. He
started<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span> looking round, but could see nothing. Then he looked up, and
there he saw a blackbird in the tree above weaving its nest, and he
said: &ldquo;Mr. Blackbird, Mr. Blackbird, what are you doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p style="margin-top: 14em;">And the
blackbird answered: &ldquo;I'm weaving my nest.&rdquo; &ldquo;What are you weaving your
nest for?&rdquo;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> asked the fox. &ldquo;To bring up my children in,&rdquo; answered the
blackbird. &ldquo;But I'm going to eat your children,&rdquo; said the fox.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 14em;">&ldquo;Don't
eat my children,&rdquo; answered the blackbird. &ldquo;Well then, feed me, I'm
hungry,&rdquo; said the fox. At that the blackbird began to fret and to worry:
how should he feed the fox?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> Then he flew off into the village, and
brought back a chicken for the fox.</p>

Mr. Blackbird, you fed me, didn't you?&rdquo; And the blackbird answered:
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said the fox, &ldquo;give me a drink!&rdquo; At that the
black<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>bird began to fret and to worry: how was he to get the fox a
drink? Then he flew off into the village, and brought back a little
pailful of water for the fox.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 12em;">And the fox had a good drink, and after a little he said: &ldquo;Mr.
Blackbird, Mr. Blackbird, you fed me, didn't you?&rdquo; And the blackbird
answered:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span> &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; &ldquo;And you got me a drink?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said the
fox, &ldquo;come and pull me out of the hole!&rdquo; At that the blackbird began to
fret and to worry: how could he pull the fox out of the hole?</p>

<p style="margin-top: 14em;">Then he began to gather sticks in the forest and started throwing them into the
hole. And he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span> kept throwing them in and throwing them in, till he filled
the hole. And the fox climbed up on to the sticks and out of the hole.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 14em;">And when he had climbed out, he lay down right under the tree. And there
he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span> lay and lay, and he said to the blackbird: &ldquo;Look here, you fed me,
didn't you, Mr. Blackbird?&rdquo;</p>

got<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span> me a drink?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; &ldquo;And you pulled me out of the hole?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said the fox, &ldquo;now make me laugh!&rdquo; At that the blackbird
began to fret and to worry: how should he make the fox laugh? At last he
said: &ldquo;Very well, I'll tell you what I'll do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I'll fly into the village,
and you run after me.&rdquo; So they agreed to do that, and the blackbird flew
off into the village and perched on the gate of a rich<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span> peasant's house,
while the fox lay down under the gateway. Then the blackbird began to
sing: &ldquo;Mistress, Mistress, bring a lump of fat! Mistress, Mistress,
bring a lump of fat!&rdquo; And the fox said: &ldquo;That's fine, let's have it
again!&rdquo;</p>
